## Overview
The Employee Management Flask Application is a **production-deployed web application** built using Flask and PostgreSQL.  
It supports **user authentication**, **employee CRUD operations**, and demonstrates real-world backend development practices including cloud deployment, environment-based configuration, and session management.

The application is deployed on **Render** and is suitable for showcasing backend and full-stack fundamentals to recruiters.

## Database
- **PostgreSQL (Production)**
- Hosted on **Render**
- Connected securely using environment variables

The database stores:
- User accounts (authentication)
- Employee records (CRUD operations)

---

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Framework:** Flask  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy  
- **Authentication:** Flask-Login  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Deployment Platform:** Render  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Documentation and System Design

This project follows a **documentation-first approach** to ensure clarity,
maintainability, and scalability.

### Included Documentation
- **Doxygen-based developer documentation**
- **Sequence Call Flow Diagrams** (Login & request lifecycle)
- **System Architecture Diagram** (Client–Server model)

All documentation sources are maintained under the `/docs` directory:
```
/docs
├── Doxyfile
└── diagrams
    ├── login_sequence.svg
    └── architecture_diagram.svg
```
To generate the documentation locally:
```bash
doxygen docs/Doxyfile
```
